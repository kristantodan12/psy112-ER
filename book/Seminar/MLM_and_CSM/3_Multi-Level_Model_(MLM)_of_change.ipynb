    "## Multi-Level Model (MLM)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "So far we have counted on having the ideal conditions for performing ANOVA: our groups were equal in number and, more importantly, our dataset was complete. We didn't have any missing values. As you may imagine, such perfect conditions are rather rare in evaluation research, particularly in longitudinal designs because several participants drop out. \n",
    "\n",
    "This scenario brings up challenges that ANOVA-related analysis approaches can't deal with in a straightforward way. ANOVA would solve the missing values problem by removing of cases with missing values. Remember, however, that measurements re costly and a small sample reduces statistical power. You or the company/hospital/practice spent so much time testing participants and you do not want to dispose of valuable data that has been acquired. Instead, you can use an alternative to ANOVA that is able to reliably model the information that is available. \n",
    "\n",
    "MLMs are not only great because they can deal with missing values, but also because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MLMs can estimate individual differences in change via the variance of random slopes. Remember: Earlier, researchers calculated the difference score to investigate individual differences in change, but the approach is biased by **variance restriction of the difference score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* MLMs also estimate individual differences in starting values (pre-intervention scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The fixed effects will provide an estimate of the average starting value of the outcome and its change. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Interaction effects between levels (i.e., cross-level interactions) will inform us whether the change and individual differences in change depend on the group (treatment or control) and on further person specific variables like emotional intelligence in our example (variable \"EM\" in data frame). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following exercise, we apply the `lmer()` function in R. We fit a model by regressing depression scores onto *time*. As the *random* part of the function, we include \"id\" to denote the observational units within which the measurements are clustered (contextual variable). "
