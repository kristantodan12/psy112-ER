    "## Propensity Score Matching\n",
    "### 1. Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "**PSM** constitutes a powerful technique in the context of observational studies. It aims to improve the study design by identifying the best comparable observational units (e.g., individuals, schools, companies etc.) to be included in the investigation. This capability is highly relevant because it permits observational studies to resemble one of the most important characteristics of purely experimental designs: **Random allocation of observational units to treatment conditions** (e.g., the levels of an independent variable). \n",
    "\n",
    "In a **RCT** study, often thought of as the gold standard approach to estimate treatment effects, the influence of potential confounders is reduced by random allocation of observational units to treatment conditions. This ensures that in each intervention group (e.g. therapy and control), relevant variables that might significantly explain variance in an outcome variable are balanced between the groups, thus minimizing their explanatory power across groups. In our example, we aim to compare individuals in terms of their facial emotion recognition performance. However, the literature suggests that fluid intelligence, biological sex and age are significantly related to this outcome variable. If one of the two groups were formed by individuals who are in general more intelligent, older, and mostly females, conclusions drawn in regard to the impact of an independent variable would not be **reliable** because observed differences in the dependent variable might have been caused by sex, intelligence or age (confounder effects). By randomly allocating participants to either group, we expect these variables to be balanced across the groups and therefore, not to have an effect on group differences on the outcome variable. Great! We have a chance to increase the **internal validity** of our experiment by minimizing the role of external variables (confounders). The problem is that in evaluation research, it is rarely possible to assign units to treatment groups by a random allocation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, evaluation research normally deals with scenarios in which groups are already constituted, for instance when comparing classes within a school, individuals from different companies or when investigating **subject variables**. That is, if we want to compare participants with and without an autism disorder diagnostic, it would not make sense to randomly allocate participants in a control group and an intervention group, as the intervention group is by definition, formed by participants with autism disorder. **PSM** allows us to create different groups in which the effect of confounders is minimized by matching observational units accounting for covariates. In brief, **PSM** yields treatment groups that are equivalent in a set of relevant variables, in our example, biological sex, age and fluid intelligence. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Propensity scores** are **probabilities** of treatment assignment given covariate values at baseline. They are said to be balancing scores because conditional on them, the covariates' distributions are similar across groups. This means that in a set of individuals with similar propensity scores, the covariates' distributions are similar in the control and intervention groups.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see how it works. First, let us load our data again and perform some preprocessing:"

This is evidenced by the substantial reduction in the **Standardized Mean Differences** and **eCDF statistics** for all covariates, bringing them to negligible levels. This successful balancing provides a much stronger foundation for making causal inferences, as you can be more confident that any difference found in your outcome is due to the treatment itself, not to these pre-existing confounding variables."

The first cell, under \"Unmatched Treatment Units\" is empty because all intervention observations were used for matching. This is not the case for the control group. Note that each dot under \"Matched Treatment Units\" has a corresponding dot under \"Unmatched Treatment Units\" (they are \"in line\"). This is an indication of how the matching procedure worked, meaning that the observations were matched considering their propensity scores. Finally, remember that propensity scores are probability values, so the maximal possible value is 1."
