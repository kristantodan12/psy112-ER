It states that the expected outcome `Y` (social phobia), for a person with characteristics `Z` and receiving treatment `X`, is the sum of a baseline outcome `g0(Z)` and a treatment effect `g1(Z)`. The indicator function `I_X=1` ensures that the treatment effect `g1(Z)` is \"switched on\" (added to the baseline) only for individuals in the treatment group (where X=1).\n",

    "\n",
    "    3.  **`g1(Z) = g100 + g101*Z1 + ...`**: This is the **Effect Function**. It specifies the model for the conditional causal effectâ€”the difference between STPP and CBT. This equation allows the treatment effect to vary depending on the covariates. The `g100` term represents the main effect when all covariates are zero, while the subsequent terms (`g101*Z1`, etc.) represent interaction effects, testing whether the treatment is more or less effective for people with different characteristics.\n",

It represents a baseline against which the treatment group is compared. The function itself is composed of a main intercept (`g000`), which is the expected outcome for a person in the CBT group when all covariates are zero, and a series of coefficients (`g001` through `g008`) that represent the unique effect of each covariate on the outcome *within the CBT group*.\n",

This function is composed of a main effect (`g100`), which represents the difference between STPP and CBT when all covariates are zero, and a series of **interaction effects** (`g101` through `g108`).

    "    2.  **There are significant effects of the covariates in the control group.** This tests whether the set of covariates (Z1-Z8) has any predictive power on the outcome *within the reference group (CBT) only*. Essentially, it tests if the `g0(Z)` function is better at predicting outcomes than just a single average value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.  **There are interaction effects.** This tests whether the effect of the treatment varies depending on the participants' characteristics. The null hypothesis is that all interaction terms (`g101` through `g108`) are simultaneously zero. It asks: \"Is the difference between STPP and CBT the same for everyone, or does it change for people with different covariate values?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.  **There are treatment effects.** This is a stricter test than the average effect. It tests if the *entire effect function*, `g1(Z)`, is equal to zero. This means testing if the main effect (`g100`) AND all interaction effects are simultaneously zero. It asks: \"Is the treatment completely ineffective for every possible subgroup, or is there an effect for at least one group?\"\n",

    "* **Conclusion from the statistical tests:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The p-values from the Wald Chi-square test allow us to make decisions on these hypotheses:\n",
    "    * The p-value for **average effects** is **8.23e-05**. Since this is < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant average difference between STPP and CBT.\n",
    "    * The p-value for **covariate effects in the control group** is **0**, which is extremely small. We reject the null hypothesis, confirming that the covariates are significant predictors of social phobia within the CBT group.\n",
    "    * The p-value for **interaction effects** is **0.00416**. Since this is > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no significant evidence that the treatment effect differs across people with different characteristics.\n",
    "    * The p-value for the overall **treatment effects** is **7.55e-06**. Since this is < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, confirming that the treatment has a significant effect overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This final section of the output summarizes the practical implications of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adjusted Means**: These are the estimated average outcomes for each group after controlling for the covariates.\n",
    "    * The adjusted mean for the CBT group (`Adj.Mean0`) is **0.967**.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Average Effects**: This provides the overall **Average Causal Effect (ACE)**.\n",
    "    * The average effect (`E[g1(Z)]`) is **0.176**, which is simply the difference between the two adjusted means.\n",
    "    * This effect is statistically significant (p=8.23e-05), with a standardized effect size of 0.439.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ### **Effects given a Treatment Condition: Is the Effect the Same for Everyone?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section essentially asks: Was the treatment effect consistent for both groups of people in the study? Or did the people who were assigned to STPP happen to be a group that was destined to respond better (or worse) to it anyway? It does this by calculating the effect separately for the people in each original group.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * #### **Average Treatment effect on the Treated (ATT): The Real-World Effect**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is the most straightforward result. It looks only at the group of people who actually received STPP and answers the question: \"For this specific group, what was the real, measured effect of STPP compared to what we would have expected if they had received CBT?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The output shows the ATT (`E[g1(Z)|X=1]`) is **0.172** (p=3.13e-04). This is a statistically significant, positive effect experienced by the group that received the STPP therapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * #### **Average Treatment effect on the Untreated (ATU): The \"What If?\" Effect**\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is the counterfactual part, which is more abstract. Think of it like two farmers using different fertilizers. The ATU asks: \"If the farmer who used the standard fertilizer had used the new one instead, what would their crop yield have been?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    * In our study, this answers the question: \"For the group of people who actually received CBT, what *would have been* the average effect of STPP if we could magically go back in time and give them STPP instead?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The output shows the ATU (`E[g1(Z)|X=0]`) is **0.180** (p=9.96e-05). This is a statistically significant hypothetical effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * #### **Interpretation: Why the Similarity of ATT and ATU is So Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "    In your data, the real-world effect (ATT = 0.172) is almost identical to the \"what if\" effect (ATU = 0.180). This consistency is a very important finding and is exactly what we hope to see in a well-designed Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **What it means**: Because participants were assigned to CBT or STPP randomly, the two groups were, on average, equivalent at the start of the study. They had similar levels of motivation, similar comorbidities, etc. Since the people in both groups are so similar, it makes sense that they would respond to the STPP treatment in a very similar way.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **The Conclusion**: This result gives us strong confidence that our findings are not due to selection bias (e.g., it wasn't just that the \"easier\" patients happened to end up in the STPP group). It suggests the positive effect of STPP (compared to CBT) is **robust and generalizable** across the different types of people in the study, which strengthens the validity of the overall Average Causal Effect (ACE).\n"
