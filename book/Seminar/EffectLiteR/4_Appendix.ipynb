    "This first block tells us about the model's convergence and overall fit to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Convergence and Observations**:\n",
    "    * `lavaan (0.5-22) converged normally after 338 iterations`: This is good news. It confirms that the statistical algorithm successfully found a stable solution for the model parameters.\n",
    "    * `Number of observations per group`: We have **170** participants in Group 0 (CBT) and **158** in Group 1 (STPP).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overall Model Fit Statistics**:\n",
    "    * `P-value (Chi-square) = 1.000`: The null hypothesis of the Chi-Square test is that the model fits the data perfectly. A high p-value (>.05) means we do not reject this hypothesis. A value of 1.000 indicates a perfect fit.\n",
    "    * `CFI = 1.000` and `TLI = 1.086`: The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) are measures of how well our model fits compared to a baseline \"worst-fit\" model. Values > 0.95 are considered excellent. The values here indicate a perfect fit.\n",
    "    * `RMSEA = 0.000` and `SRMR = 0.000`: The Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) are measures of error. Values < 0.06 are considered good. The values of 0.000 here indicate a perfect fit.\n",

The significant `z-value` and `P(>|z|)` columns for the estimated loadings (e.g., `l123`, `l133`) show that the chosen indicator variables are strongly related to their respective latent variables.\n",
    "* **Regressions**: This shows how the covariates predict the outcome (`eta`) **within the CBT group**. For example:\n",
    "    * The effect of `comorbd` (`a001`) is **0.119** (p=0.002), meaning higher comorbidity is associated with higher social phobia scores in the CBT group.\n",
    "    * The effect of `iip.lov` (`a002`) is **-0.315** (p<0.001), meaning this covariate is significantly and negatively associated with social phobia in the CBT group.\n",
    "* **Intercepts**: This shows the baseline values for all variables in the CBT group. The intercept for the outcome `eta` (`a000`) is **-0.077**, which is the expected social phobia score for someone in the CBT group when all covariates are zero.\n",
    "* **Variances**: This shows the variance of each variable. The variance for `.eta` (**0.124**) is the *residual* or unexplained variance in the outcome for the CBT group after accounting for all the predictors.\n",

    "* **Latent Variables**: The factor loadings (e.g., `l123`) have the exact same estimates as in the CBT group. This is because we constrained them to be equal to test for measurement invariance.\n",
    "* **Regressions**: This shows how the covariates predict the outcome **within the STPP group**. We can compare these to the CBT group to see where interactions might arise. For example:\n",
    "    * The effect of `xi1` (`a104`) is **0.778** (p<0.001). This is much larger than the effect in the CBT group (0.414), suggesting an interaction.\n",

    "* **`adjmean` (Adjusted Means)**: These are the covariate-adjusted average outcomes for each group.\n",
    "    * The adjusted mean for the CBT group (`adjmean0`) is **0.967**.\n",
    "    * The adjusted mean for the STPP group (`adjmean1`) is **1.143**.\n",
