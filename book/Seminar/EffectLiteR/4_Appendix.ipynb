    "### **Running the Analysis Manually with R Code**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we explored the results of our causal analysis using the interactive `EffectLiteR` Shiny web application. Now, we will demonstrate how to perform a similar analysis manually by writing and executing R code directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our model is complex and includes several latent variables , we will use a robust **two-step approach** to ensure the model runs correctly and to simplify the interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **First, we will fit a measurement model.** We will use the `lavaan` package, which `EffectLiteR` is built on, to define the relationships between our observed survey items and their underlying latent constructs. From this model, we will calculate the \"factor scores\" for each latent variable, effectively turning our unobserved constructs into new, calculated variables for each participant.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Second, we will run the main `effectLite` analysis.** However, instead of a complex latent variable model, we will use a simpler model that uses the factor scores we just created as regular, observed covariates. This simplifies the process while still accounting for the nuanced concepts measured by the latent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "> **Important Note on the Model**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Please note that the two-step approach shown in the code below represents a slightly simplified version of the full model. The `EffectLiteR` Shiny app, by default, runs a more complex, fully simultaneous Structural Equation Model.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You may notice some small differences between the results from this script and the results from the Shiny app. These differences arise from the different modeling strategies (two-step vs. fully simultaneous). The complete `lavaan` syntax for the model generated by the Shiny app can be found under the **\"lavaan Syntax\"** tab within that application. The explanation of the syntax is also provided below, including for the output. As a homework, please compare this two-step vs. fully simultaneous approaches.\n",

    "### Interpretation of the `lavaan` Model Output\n",
    "\n",
    "This output provides a comprehensive look at the results of the structural equation model estimated by `EffectLiteR`. We can interpret it section by section.\n",

    "\n",
    "This first block tells us about the model's convergence and overall fit to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Convergence and Observations**:\n",
    "    * `lavaan (0.5-22) converged normally after 338 iterations`: This is good news. It confirms that the statistical algorithm successfully found a stable solution for the model parameters.\n",
    "    * `Number of observations per group`: We have **170** participants in Group 0 (CBT) and **158** in Group 1 (STPP).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overall Model Fit Statistics**:\n",
    "    * `P-value (Chi-square) = 1.000`: The null hypothesis of the Chi-Square test is that the model fits the data perfectly. A high p-value (>.05) means we do not reject this hypothesis. A value of 1.000 indicates a perfect fit.\n",
    "    * `CFI = 1.000` and `TLI = 1.086`: The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) are measures of how well our model fits compared to a baseline \"worst-fit\" model. Values > 0.95 are considered excellent. The values here indicate a perfect fit.\n",
    "    * `RMSEA = 0.000` and `SRMR = 0.000`: The Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) are measures of error. Values < 0.06 are considered good. The values of 0.000 here indicate a perfect fit.\n",

The significant `z-value` and `P(>|z|)` columns for the estimated loadings (e.g., `l123`, `l133`) show that the chosen indicator variables are strongly related to their respective latent variables.\n",
    "* **Regressions**: This shows how the covariates predict the outcome (`eta`) **within the CBT group**. For example:\n",
    "    * The effect of `comorbd` (`a001`) is **0.119** (p=0.002), meaning higher comorbidity is associated with higher social phobia scores in the CBT group.\n",
    "    * The effect of `iip.lov` (`a002`) is **-0.315** (p<0.001), meaning this covariate is significantly and negatively associated with social phobia in the CBT group.\n",
    "* **Intercepts**: This shows the baseline values for all variables in the CBT group. The intercept for the outcome `eta` (`a000`) is **-0.077**, which is the expected social phobia score for someone in the CBT group when all covariates are zero.\n",
    "* **Variances**: This shows the variance of each variable. The variance for `.eta` (**0.124**) is the *residual* or unexplained variance in the outcome for the CBT group after accounting for all the predictors.\n",

    "This block shows the same parameters, but for the treatment group (STPP).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Latent Variables**: The factor loadings (e.g., `l123`) have the exact same estimates as in the CBT group. This is because we constrained them to be equal to test for measurement invariance.\n",
    "* **Regressions**: This shows how the covariates predict the outcome **within the STPP group**. We can compare these to the CBT group to see where interactions might arise. For example:\n",
    "    * The effect of `xi1` (`a104`) is **0.778** (p<0.001). This is much larger than the effect in the CBT group (0.414), suggesting an interaction.\n",

    "    * `g102` is the interaction effect for `iip.lov`: **0.367** (p=0.004). This is a **significant interaction**, meaning the effect of STPP vs. CBT is different for people with different levels of `iip.lov`.\n",
    "    * `g104` is the interaction effect for `xi1`: **0.364** (p=0.012). This is also a **significant interaction**.\n",

    "* **`adjmean` (Adjusted Means)**: These are the covariate-adjusted average outcomes for each group.\n",
    "    * The adjusted mean for the CBT group (`adjmean0`) is **0.967**.\n",
    "    * The adjusted mean for the STPP group (`adjmean1`) is **1.143**.\n",

    "    * `Eg1gx0` (ATU): The effect for those in the CBT group is **0.172** (p<0.001).\n",
    "    * `Eg1gx1` (ATT): The effect for those in the STPP group is **0.180** (p<0.001).\n",
