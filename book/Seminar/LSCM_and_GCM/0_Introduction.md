# LSCM and GCM

Dear students, 

In our last session, we started to work with models that are useful when investigating change. Specifically, we covered **repeated measures ANOVA** and two great alternative options that overcome the limitations of ANOVA and allow researchers to answer much more interesting and complex questions. These alternatives were multilevel models (**MLMs**) and change score models (**CSMs**). In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement more sophisticated CSMs and growth curve models (**GCMs**).

Here is the outline for today. 

* Overview
* Growth curve models 
* Latent change score models
* Multi-method/group/trait latent change score models
